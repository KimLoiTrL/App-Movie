    <string name="simple_text">Venom: Let There Be Carnage is set over a year after the events of Venom, with journalist Eddie Brock struggling to adjust to his new life as the host of the alien symbiote Venom. This time he will be challenged by serial killer Cletus Kasady, who similarly becomes the host of the symbiote Carnage and escapes from prison after a failed execution. While Hardy uses Venom of assistance to become a vigilante, Kasady only wants to cause carnage as, well, Carnage.</string>
